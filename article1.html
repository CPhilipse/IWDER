                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    I’ve been using Things for years to manage tasks, projects, and just general things. The app is based loosely off the principles of Getting Things Done,
                    a book that promotes a productivity framework of capturing, organizing, and acting on tasks and ideas.
                    The high level ideas of Getting Things Done mesh well with how I naturally operate,
                    but I find learning and sticking to every little part of the system is a sizable project in and of itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, I work with a modification of the <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr> system that is pared down to its basics with the goal of being simple enough to stick to,
                    but just involved enough to be effective. My minimal framework was made specifically for use with Things,
                    but you should be able to use most task management platforms (or even pencil and paper) to implement it.

                <h4>Collection</h4>
                <p>
                    Start by forming the habit of collecting your tasks and ideas the moment you think of them.
                    Toss them all into the Things Inbox and worry about triage and organization later.
                    The Inbox functions as the unstructured collection of all new items that have yet to be taken through triage.
                    Do whatever you can to minimize the friction of recording actionable tasks to the Inbox.
                    A get things done system is no good if you can’t remember what you have to get done.
