                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Uber’s Base design system offers a set of map marker components that are used extensively across our products,
                    displayed any time we feature a map to the user. We’ve recently come across the need to
                    showcase additional context on the map markers and settled on adding badges — an existing Base component — to achieve that.

                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                <p>
                    The challenge was that both the map markers and the badges had multiple variations. Markers can be customized by size,
                    needle length, icon slots and layout behavior, while the badges can have multiple sizes, label, and icon styles.
                    The final set of badge-supporting map markers is a combination of all these options, a total of 256 new components.

                <h4>Common approach</h4>
                <p>
                    The common approach is for a designer to manually create these new components, which is not only inefficient but very error prone
                    due to the repetitiveness and volume of work required to create all variants and individually test them under multiple scenarios.
