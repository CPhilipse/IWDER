                <p>
                    When you think of animating <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> properties, which ones come to mind? I recently started wondering about the ones that don’t come to mind &#45
                    properties that aren’t typically associated with animation, but turn out to be animatable.
                </p>

                    This articles explores some of the unexpected things that <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can animate and some nifty things you can do by animating them.

                <h4>Animating Shadows</h4>
                <p>
                    The box-shadow property can take multiple sets of values, as a comma-separated list, to create multiple shadows.
                    By animating box-shadow, you animate a list of shadows into another list of shadows.
                    Each shadow in the starting list is interpolated to the corresponding shadow in the ending list. Each interpolation is smooth,
                    unless one has inset and the other doesn’t, in which case the entire animation falls back to being discrete.
                </p>
